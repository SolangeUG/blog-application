This web project is about building, in a step-by-step fashion, a fully-functional blog that has user registration, submitting links, security, caching, and viewing everything together. The final product will be deployed online via Google App Engine.

## Languages - Libraries - Tools

- [Python 2.7.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)
- [Jinja2 templating engine](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/)
- [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/download)
- Any code/text editor ([atom](https://atom.io/)) or IDE ([PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)) of your choice.

## Deploying the application

> Google App Engine allows to build scalable web and mobile backends in any language on Googleâ€™s infrastructure.

In this project, we use the original local development App Engine SDK for Python.
The latest version - `1.9.66` - can be downloaded [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/download#python_windows).

In order to deploy the application online, you'll need to sign up for a [google account](https://developers.google.com/), if you don't have one already.

Here's a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euox_iFW2eM) on how to install and use Google App Engine in creating and deploying applications.
